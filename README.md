# Orion for Reddit
### Cool name, but what is it?
Orion is a new Reddit app for iOS.
### Ok, that sounds kinda neat, but don't we already have a bunch of those? The official Reddit app, and Apollo, to name a few. Why do we need another one?
There's just something special about making your own app, y'know? I want to make my own mark, and being able to design a Reddit client is a great way to do it.

There's this endless stream of content on Reddit, and, as the developer, I can dictate how it should be layed out and styled. There's something just magical about that idea to me.

Furthermore, I feel like the moderation tools on the iOS Reddit apps leave what to be desired, and what better way to address that issue than to DIY!

### Are you going to monetize this app?
As of now, I have no intention of doing so, but as things change, I will update this section accordingly.

### This awful README.md emotionally moved me, and I am filled with an overwhelming desire to collaborate with / hire you. How can I reach you?
